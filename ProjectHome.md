# Introduction #
This WIP repository contains a large selection of American television channel and radio station logos for use with [MediaPortal](http://www.team-mediaportal.com/) and the [LogoManager plugin](http://www.team-mediaportal.com/extensions/utilities/logomanager).

Instructions on using LogoManager are available [here](http://code.google.com/p/mediaportal-uk-logos/#Instructions).

["As a note, a lot of the new logos are forgoing their 'HD' symbols all together. So those with both the HD and SD versions may have the same logos."](http://www.thegreenbutton.tv/forums/viewtopic.php?p=62295#p62295) - makryger of My Channel Logos.
